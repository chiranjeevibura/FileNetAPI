Speaker Notes
Good morning/afternoon, esteemed executives. Today, I'm presenting a proof-of-concept (POC) for migrating data from our FileNet P8 (Oracle database) to MongoDB, a NoSQL database. This POC utilizes Apache Spark, a powerful tool for handling large-scale data processing. Our goal is to establish a scalable and efficient data migration strategy for future endeavors.

Slide 2: Business Challenge
Title: The Challenge: Migrating Legacy Data
Bullet Point 1: Siloed Data in FileNet P8 (Oracle)
Bullet Point 2: Need for Scalable and Flexible Storage (MongoDB)
Bullet Point 3: Requirement for Efficient Data Movement for Future Migrations

Speaker Notes
Currently, our data resides within the FileNet P8 system, an Oracle relational database management system (RDBMS). While it serves us well, it may not be ideal for future needs. We require a more scalable and flexible storage solution, which is where MongoDB, a NoSQL database, comes in. This POC focuses on developing a process for efficient data movement that can be leveraged for future large-scale migrations.

Slide 3: Proposed Solution: Apache Spark
Title: Apache Spark: The Powerhouse for Data Migration

Bullet Point 1: Distributed Processing for Large Datasets
Bullet Point 2: In-Memory Processing for Speed
Bullet Point 3: ETL Capabilities: Extract, Transform, Load
Speaker Notes
This POC utilizes Apache Spark, a distributed processing framework designed for handling massive datasets. Spark excels at in-memory processing, significantly accelerating data transformations. Additionally, Spark offers built-in capabilities for the entire Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) pipeline, making it a one-stop shop for data migration.

Slide 4: POC Design: ETL with Spark
Title: A 3-Step Approach: Extract, Transform, Load
Bullet Point 1: Extract: Read Data from Oracle using Spark SQL
Bullet Point 2: Transform: Cleanse and Prepare Data within Spark DataFrames
Bullet Point 3: Load: Write Transformed Data to MongoDB
Speaker Notes
Our POC leverages Spark's ETL capabilities. In the Extract phase, Spark SQL reads data from the Oracle database. The Transform phase utilizes Spark DataFrames, in-memory distributed datasets, for data cleansing and preparation. Finally, the Load phase writes the transformed data to MongoDB.

Slide 5: Transformation Details
Title: Data Wrangling with Spark DataFrames
Bullet Point 1: Choice List Replacement: Standardize Values
Bullet Point 2: Constant to String Conversion: Improve Clarity
Bullet Point 3: Oracle Blob Decoding: Generate HCP Path
Bullet Point 4: Data Type Conversions: Ensure Compatibility
Bullet Point 5: UUID Generation: Unique Identifiers for Records

Speaker Notes
The transformation phase plays a crucial role in data preparation. We leverage Spark DataFrames to perform various tasks:

Choice List Replacement: Standardize values from dropdown menus.
Constant to String Conversion: Enhance data clarity.
Oracle Blob Decoding: Extract valuable information from Oracle BLOBs (Binary Large Objects) and generate HCP (Hybrid Cloud Platform) paths.
Data Type Conversions: Ensure compatibility between source and target databases.
UUID Generation: Assign unique identifiers (Universally Unique Identifiers) to records for better tracking.
