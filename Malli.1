Subject: Congratulations and Readiness for Expanded Roles

Dear [Manager’s Name],

I hope this email finds you well. Since I missed our last 1-on-1 due to my vacation, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out directly instead of waiting for our next scheduled discussion.

First and foremost, congratulations on your recent achievements and the expanded scope of your leadership! It’s inspiring to see your accomplishments, and I truly value the opportunity to work under your guidance. Staying aligned with your leadership is incredibly important to me, as I believe it provides an excellent environment to learn, grow, and contribute meaningfully.

With the recent changes, I would like to express my readiness to take on any bigger roles or responsibilities that may align with the new structure. I have been preparing myself for such opportunities for some time, and I’m eager to step up, contribute, and make a positive impact. This is also a significant moment for me from a career growth and visa sponsorship perspective, and I see this as a critical step in achieving both organizational and personal goals.

I am open to discussing all potential options and would be grateful for the opportunity to explore how I can best support you and the team moving forward.

Thank you for your continued support and guidance, and I look forward to contributing further under your leadership.

Best regards,
Chiru

This version is respectful, congratulatory, and highlights your eagerness and preparedness effectively.
