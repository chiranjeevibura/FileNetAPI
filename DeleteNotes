Subject: Migration Process for Data from Oracle to MongoDB

Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well. This email outlines the steps required to perform the data migration from Oracle to MongoDB. Please follow the instructions carefully to ensure a smooth and successful migration.

**Steps for Migration:**

1. **Check Spark Status:**
   - Before initiating the migration, check whether Spark is running using the `check_spark.sh` script.
   - Command: `./check_spark.sh`
   - If Spark is running, proceed to the next step. If not, start the Spark master and worker nodes as described below.

2. **Start Spark Master and Worker Nodes:**
   - If Spark is not running, start the Spark master node using the `start_master.sh` script.
   - Command: `./start_master.sh`
   - Next, start the Spark worker node using the `start_worker.sh` script.
   - Command: `./start_worker.sh`

3. **Review and Update Configuration File:**
   - Review the `config_<env>.ini` file to ensure all parameters are correctly set.
   - Update the Oracle and MongoDB connection parameters, queries, and any other custom properties as needed.

4. **Initiate Migration:**
   - Once the configuration file is ready, initiate the migration by running the `sparkmigrator_edocs_ce1dev_to_cdldev.sh` script.
   - Depending on the data volume, you can run the script in the foreground or background.
   - Command (foreground): `./sparkmigrator_edocs_ce1dev_to_cdldev.sh`
   - Command (background): `nohup ./sparkmigrator_edocs_ce1dev_to_cdldev.sh &`

5. **Review Migrated Data:**
   - After the migration is completed, review the data in the respective MongoDB collection to ensure the data has been migrated correctly.
   - Verify the data integrity and consistency in the MongoDB collection.

Please ensure all steps are followed in sequence to avoid any issues during the migration process. If you encounter any problems or need assistance, feel free to reach out to the support team.

Thank you for your cooperation.
