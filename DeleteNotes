**Story Title:** Implement FileNet Document Ingestion with Unique ID Generation and Error Handling

**Story Description:**
As a FileNet architect, I want to implement a document ingestion process that reads metadata and file paths from a CSV file, generates unique IDs for each document, and handles errors efficiently, so that I can avoid duplicate document ingestion and manage successful and failed ingestions separately.

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **CSV File Processing:**
   - The system should read input data from a CSV file containing columns: `filePath`, `className`, `propertyName`, and `propertyValue`.
   - The system should handle CSV files with multiple rows, processing each row independently.

2. **Unique ID Generation:**
   - The system should generate a unique ID for each document based on the metadata provided in the CSV file.
   - The unique ID should be consistent for the same set of metadata to avoid duplicates if the same CSV is processed again.

3. **Document Ingestion:**
   - The system should add documents to the FileNet repository using the metadata and file paths provided in the CSV file.
   - The system should use the generated unique ID as a custom unique identifier for the documents.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - The system should handle errors gracefully, skipping failed rows and continuing with the rest of the CSV.
   - The system should differentiate between types of errors (e.g., duplicate values, index errors, file-related errors) and provide custom error messages.

5. **Success and Error Logs:**
   - The system should create two output CSV files: `success.csv` and `error.csv`.
   - `success.csv` should contain the original CSV data plus an additional column for the generated unique ID for each successfully ingested document.
   - `error.csv` should contain the original CSV data plus an additional column for the custom error message for each failed row.

6. **Resource Management:**
   - The system should properly manage resources, ensuring that all file readers and writers are closed after processing.
   - The system should use try-with-resources to handle file operations and ensure that resources are automatically closed.

7. **Logging:**
   - The system should log the generated unique IDs to the console for each processed document.

#### **Tasks:**

1. **Develop CSV Reading and Processing Functionality:**
   - Implement code to read and parse the CSV file.
   - Handle multiple rows and extract necessary metadata for each document.

2. **Implement Unique ID Generation:**
   - Develop a function to generate consistent unique IDs based on the metadata.
   - Ensure the generated IDs are unique and consistent for the same set of metadata.

3. **Document Ingestion to FileNet:**
   - Implement code to create and add documents to the FileNet repository using the provided metadata and file paths.
   - Use the generated unique ID as a custom unique identifier for each document.

4. **Error Handling and Custom Messages:**
   - Implement error handling to catch and process different types of exceptions.
   - Provide custom error messages based on the exception type and content.

5. **Output Success and Error Logs:**
   - Implement code to create and write to `success.csv` and `error.csv` files.
   - Ensure the correct information is logged, including unique IDs for successful ingestions and error messages for failed rows.

6. **Resource Management and Logging:**
   - Use try-with-resources for all file operations.
   - Ensure proper resource management to avoid leaks.
   - Log unique IDs to the console for each processed document.
