**Problem Statement:**

We encountered an issue with our FileNet P8 system where one of the staging areas, `cache03`, was being utilized by other components, such as CSS, leading to rapid disk space consumption. This caused the staging area to reach 100% capacity. In FileNet P8, the staging area temporarily stores content before committing it to the content repository. When the staging area is full, the system cannot finalize the content element, resulting in a size mismatch error, specifically the `FNRCC0148E: CONTENT_CA_FINALIZE_FAILED_SIZE` error.

**Fix Implemented:**

To address this issue, I have removed `cache03` from the P8 pool of staging areas. The system is now using only the remaining two staging area partitions, `cache01` and `cache02`. This adjustment should provide a permanent fix and prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.

**Next Steps:**

Please continue to test the system and monitor for any similar issues. If you encounter any further problems, do not hesitate to reach out to me directly.

Thank you.
