All Set for the Feb Release â€“ LOS Migration Locked & Loaded!

Hey TroV,

Weâ€™re all set for the February release!

Sureshâ€™s documentation gave me a brief scare when the HCP Path validation initially failed. After a deep dive, I cross-checked the data and discovered that it actually resides in the HCP deviceâ€”contrary to what was documented. I updated the code, reran the tests, and weâ€™re now in the clear.

The entire processâ€”batch creation, migration, and reconciliationâ€”wrapped up in just 6 minutes. The real trick? Optimizing batch sizes.
	â€¢	A 50K batch takes around 15 minutes for migration plus a couple more for reconciliation.
	â€¢	But when we go all in with a full-size 200K+ batch, we complete everything in under 10 minutes!

Efficiency unlocked! ðŸš€
