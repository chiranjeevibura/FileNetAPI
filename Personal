Hi Abbab,

I hope this email finds you well. Matt shared your contact with me so I could reach out to explain my situation and seek your assistance in moving my request forward.

I joined the bank in February 2023 and was informed during my hiring process that my Permanent Residency petition would be filed after one year of employment. Having worked with Bank of America for over a decade at the Hyderabad, India office, I have always considered it my extended family, trusting that everything would be taken care of without needing to ask for every detail before joining. With this belief, I joined the bank.

Upon joining, I had to forfeit my previously approved I-140 petition due to the inability to fulfill the required six-month employment period with my previous employer, leading to the withdrawal of my application. After consulting with reputable attorneys, I have learned that recent amendments to the I-140 process provide an opportunity to retain the priority date and file a new I-140 petition after 180 days from the approval of the original petition, even if the 180-day employment period was not completed. The preservation of my status and priority date is of utmost importance to me and my family.

However, I have been asked to wait until the end of this year due to an additional rule requiring H-1B holders to be within 36 months, and L-1 holders within 42 months, of the FNIV date of their current visa (final expiration once all extensions are approved). Without advancing this request, there is no confirmation on whether my previous priority date can be retained, leaving me in a stressful and uncertain situation.

I kindly request your understanding and support to expedite my petition filing. The uncertainty surrounding my immigration status is causing significant stress for my family and me. In the spirit of 'family first,' which I believe is a core value we uphold at the bank, I sincerely hope my situation can be given special consideration. Timely action on this matter is crucial for our stability and well-being.

Thank you for your empathy and assistance.

Best regards,
