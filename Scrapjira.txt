Here is a suggested Jira story for developing the CDL Validator application:

Jira Story Title: Develop CDL Validator Application with Comprehensive Validation and Maintenance Features

Description:
Develop an application called CDL Validator that provides a centralized platform for validating CDL services, including CRUD operations and infrastructure components, and supports maintenance activities. The application should improve efficiency by enabling quick and effective validations, reducing maintenance time, and providing a user-friendly interface for the team. The development efforts include:

	1.	CRUD Services Validation:
	•	Implement validation for CDL services from the UI, including Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
	•	Ensure the CRUD operations’ results are consistent with expected outcomes, capturing any discrepancies.
	2.	Maintenance Activities Support:
	•	Develop features to manage maintenance activities such as starting, stopping, and checking the status of CDL services.
	•	Provide utilities to perform these actions across different environments quickly and efficiently.
	3.	Performance Validation:
	•	Measure the time taken to perform various activities and ensure performance aligns with the required standards.
	•	Implement performance metrics and monitoring for continuous assessment.
	4.	Quality Assurance (QA) Activities:
	•	Validate service availability and reliability under different conditions.
	•	Integrate internal utilities to assist the QA team in performing testing and validation activities in lower environments (dev, test, etc.).
	5.	Comprehensive Validation Dashboard:
	•	Develop a centralized dashboard to perform all validation activities in one place, making processes more efficient.
	•	Integrate with Python-based machine learning (ML) code for advanced analytics and insights.
	6.	CDL Q&A Feature:
	•	Implement a chatbot-based Q&A feature to assist users with common queries related to CDL services and validations.
	•	Leverage the chatbot for interactive troubleshooting and quick access to documentation.
	7.	Infrastructure Validation Services:
	•	Develop services to validate infrastructure components such as MongoDB, Hitachi Content Platform (HCP), and Unix systems.
	•	Ensure these services are available through the CDL Validator platform.

Acceptance Criteria:

	•	CRUD validation services for CDL are fully functional from the UI.
	•	Maintenance activities (stop, start, status checks) can be performed through the application.
	•	Performance metrics are captured and displayed on the dashboard.
	•	QA validation utilities are integrated for lower environment testing.
	•	CDL Q&A feature is available and functional for user support.
	•	Validation services for infrastructure components (MongoDB, HCP, Unix) are implemented.
	•	The CDL Validator dashboard integrates Python ML code for analytics.
	•	Documentation is available for all features.
