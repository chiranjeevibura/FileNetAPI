Hereâ€™s a refined list of tasks which can automate to ensure reliable migration while moving data from IBM FileNet P8 to CDL (MongoDB):

1. Collect P8 Metadata & Keys for Migration
Automate extraction of metadata, keys, and other critical information for each migration batch.
Ensure all necessary P8 metadata is captured for validation.
2. Prepare Testing Template for Validation
Create automated templates for validating each field and data value.
Ensure that the template supports both manual and automated testing processes.
3. Analyze Mapping Sheets
Automate the identification of key factors in the mapping sheets that can impact business logic.
Flag critical fields that require special attention during validation.
4. P8 Data-Side Validation
Metadata Not Requiring Translation: Automate the validation of metadata fields that do not require translation.
Test Coverage for Unique Fields and Values: Automatically validate all unique fields and values to ensure they are covered in testing.
Metadata Requiring Translation: Automate the identification and validation of metadata fields that need translation.
Test Coverage for Translated Fields: Ensure all fields that were part of the translation are covered in testing.
5. MongoDB New Fields Validation
Field Appearance: Automate the verification that all required fields are appearing on the target MongoDB datasource.
Data Types: Automate checks for correct data types in MongoDB after migration.
Null/Default/Mandatory Values: Verify that all null, default, and mandatory values are correctly updated in MongoDB.
6. Content Path Decryption Validation
Automate the verification that the actual content path encrypted in the P8 blob is decrypted and appears correctly as a clear text path in MongoDB.
7. Constant Value Stamping on MongoDB
Ensure that all constant values stamped on MongoDB are in line with LOB-specific requirements.
Automate checks for these constant values in MongoDB after migration.
8. Functional Testing
New Functionalities in CDL: Automate testing to confirm that new functionalities on the CDL side are applicable to the migrated data.
Comparison between Migrated vs. Created Services: Automate the comparison between migrated data and newly created data to ensure consistency and correctness in MongoDB.
9. Post-Migration Data Quality Checks
Automate checks for data integrity after migration to ensure no data loss or corruption.
Implement periodic comparison between source (P8) and target (MongoDB) to ensure continuous alignment.
10. Report Generation
Automate the generation of reports for migration progress, issues, and validation results.
Provide real-time feedback to stakeholders during migration.
