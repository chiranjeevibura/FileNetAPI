Subject: Follow-Up on Immigration Case – Request for Special Consideration

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. As we’ve discussed previously, I deeply value the opportunities and support provided by the bank. Given the recent updates from USCIS and their implications for my career and family’s future, I wanted to revisit my immigration case to request HR/Immigration’s consideration as a special case under USCIS guidelines.

Chronology of Events
I-140 Approval During Rehire Discussions

My I-140 was approved on 12/28/2022 during rehire discussions.
To ensure continuity in the hiring process, I agreed to join on 2/2/2023, aware that only 30+ days of the 180-day priority date maintenance requirement had passed, instead of the full duration.
Risk Taken with Assumptions of Support

Joining earlier than ideal was a calculated decision based on the belief that the bank would provide strong support during the PERM process.
Present Impact and Request

Despite the risk I took, I am now at a juncture where regaining my priority date and cap exemption is critical for me and my family’s future stability. My request aligns strictly with USCIS guidelines and requires no exceptions beyond what is permissible.
Relevant USCIS Guidelines
Under the EB-1C classification, USCIS recognizes roles such as "functional managers" who manage an essential function of an organization without direct supervision of employees.
Key highlights include:

Managing a critical function within the organization.
Operating at a senior level with discretion over day-to-day operations.
The details of my role at the bank align with these criteria, emphasizing my qualifications for the multinational executive or manager classification.

Impact of Support
Your assistance in addressing this matter will ensure:

Retention of my priority date and cap exemption, securing my long-term immigration path.
Stability for my family, enabling us to focus on contributing meaningfully to the bank’s goals without uncertainty.

I greatly appreciate the bank’s commitment to supporting employees and hope you can consider this request favorably. I am happy to discuss further or provide additional information to facilitate the process.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Best regards,
Chiranjeevi Bura
