Here’s a simplified yet powerful set of instructions to explain the process of pulling and processing the target data for management. The instructions are written for clarity and to ensure everyone, including non-technical stakeholders, understands what is being done and why.

### **Instructions to Pull Target Data**

#### **Objective:**
The goal of this process is to reconcile and extract relevant data from two different databases (P8 and Teradata) and prepare a unified, meaningful dataset for management to make informed decisions. 

---

### **Step-by-Step Explanation**

#### **Step 1: Read Data from P8 Database**
- We start by pulling **Application Reference Numbers (APP_REF_NO)** from the P8 database.  
- This list serves as the foundation to identify which applications are under review or reconciliation.
- **Why:** This ensures we are working with a known and relevant set of records for our analysis.

---

#### **Step 2: Read Data from Teradata Database (First Extraction)**
- Next, we extract data from the first Teradata table.  
- This includes:
  - **APP_REF_NO**: Linking applications with P8.
  - **Product Account Numbers (PROD_ACCT_NO)**: Identifiers for individual accounts.
  - **Product Code (PROD_CD)**: Specifically filtering for "CC" (Consumer Credit).  
- **Why:** This gives us a list of consumer accounts associated with the applications in P8, which is key for further reconciliation.

---

#### **Step 3: Join Data from P8 and Teradata**
- We combine the data from Step 1 (P8) and Step 2 (Teradata) by matching **APP_REF_NO**.
- This creates a unified view of application and account information, stored in a new dataset.  
- **What Happens:** At this point:
  - Only records present in both databases are retained (inner join).  
  - This ensures data accuracy and removes any irrelevant or mismatched records.

---

#### **Step 4: Read Additional Data from Teradata (Second Extraction)**
- We pull additional data from a second Teradata table, focusing on account closure and financial status.  
- This includes:
  - **PROD_ACCT_NO**: Account numbers for linking.
  - **Closure Dates (STATC_CLOSED_MAINT_DT)**: Identifying when accounts were closed.
  - **Legal Codes (STATC_LEGAL_CD)**: Regulatory information.
  - **Balances (CCL_BAL_AM, STMT_CUR_BAL_AM)**: Financial indicators for zero balance.  
- Filters are applied to ensure:
  - Accounts are closed.
  - Legal codes are present.
  - Balances are zero.
  - Closure dates are valid (excluding default values like `0001-01-01`).  
- **Why:** This ensures we’re focusing only on relevant and eligible accounts for reporting.

---

#### **Step 5: Join the Unified Data with Account Closure Data**
- We join the unified dataset from Step 3 with the closure and financial data from Step 4 on **PROD_ACCT_NO**.
- **What Happens:**  
  - This merge ensures that only accounts meeting all closure and financial criteria are included in the final dataset.  
  - Any accounts or applications that don’t meet the criteria are automatically excluded.

---

#### **Step 6: Write the Final Dataset to the Target Database**
- The final dataset is saved into the Oracle database in a table called **FINAL_TABLE**.  
- This table provides a complete and validated view of:
  - Applications.
  - Linked accounts.
  - Closure dates.
  - Legal compliance.
  - Financial status.
- **Why:** This creates a single source of truth for management to analyze and make decisions.

### **Benefits of the Process**
1. **Data Accuracy:** By filtering and joining multiple datasets, we ensure only the most relevant and valid data is included.
2. **Automation:** The entire process is automated using PySpark, ensuring efficiency and reducing manual errors.
3. **Comprehensive Insights:** The final dataset provides management with a clear view of consumer credit accounts, including their status and compliance details.
4. **Scalability:** The process is designed to handle large volumes of data across multiple systems.

### **Conclusion**
This process enables us to consolidate and reconcile critical data from different systems, ensuring management has access to accurate, actionable insights. It’s a step-by-step, systematic approach to ensure data integrity and compliance while focusing on the organization’s key priorities.
