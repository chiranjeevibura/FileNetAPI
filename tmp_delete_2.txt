**Subject:** Thank You and Warm Holiday Wishes  

Dear [Manager's Name],  

I hope this message finds you well.  

As the year comes to a close, I wanted to take a moment to thank you sincerely for the opportunity to be part of your team this year. It has been a privilege to contribute under your leadership, particularly in focusing on my favorite areas of technology—AI/ML, Spark, Python, and automation. Working on initiatives like the CDL Validator has been both exciting and rewarding, and I truly appreciate the trust and encouragement you've shown me.  

I’ve genuinely enjoyed collaborating with the team and learning from your guidance. Your leadership has been inspiring, and I am looking forward to the new year with optimism, eager to contribute further to the team’s success.  

Wishing you and your family a joyful holiday season and a prosperous year ahead. May the coming year bring great achievements and continued success for you and the team.  

Happy Holidays!  

Best regards,  
Chiranjeevi Bura
