### **Slide 4: How It Works ‚Äì AI in Action**  

#### **1. GenAI-Powered ECM Knowledge Assistant (RAG Search)**  
- Uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide **direct answers from ECM** instead of manual search.  
- Example query: *"What are the renewal terms in our vendor contracts?"* ‚Üí AI extracts key clauses.  

#### **2. AI-Powered Auto-Summarization & Risk Extraction**  
- NLP-based **contract & policy review**, highlighting **critical risks, deadlines, and obligations.**  
- Example: *Identifies hidden penalty clauses & risky terms in agreements.*  

#### **3. AI-Powered Auto-Redaction for Sensitive Data**  
- AI scans **documents & images (OCR), detects sensitive data, and applies smart redaction.**  
- Example: *Auto-removes personal info from customer records before external sharing.*  

#### **4. AI-Powered Intelligent Storage Utilization & Prediction**  
- **Forecasts storage growth & suggests auto-tiering of inactive documents** to cost-efficient storage.  
- Example: *Predicts 12-month storage needs, preventing infra overuse.*  

#### **5. AI-Based Smart Deduplication & Document Compression**  
- Uses **text similarity models** to detect **duplicate versions & redundant content** for compression.  
- Example: *Reduces 10-20% of duplicate storage, improving retrieval efficiency.*
