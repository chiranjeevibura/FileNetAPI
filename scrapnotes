JIRA Story: Migrate Metadata from P8 to CDL
Summary
Migrate metadata from a P8 database to a CDL (MongoDB) database. This migration will involve analyzing, mapping, and transferring data while ensuring data integrity and accuracy.

Acceptance Criteria
Data Accuracy: All migrated data must match the source data in P8, including null values, different possible values, and counts.
Mapping Completeness: A comprehensive mapping sheet must be created, detailing source and target column names, default values, required translations, and datatypes.
Batch Table Functionality: A separate batch table must be created in the migration database for tracking and reconciliation purposes.
Data Integrity: The migration process must maintain data integrity, ensuring no data loss or corruption.
Error Handling: A robust error handling mechanism must be in place to identify and address any issues during the migration.
Query Accuracy: Appropriate P8 queries must be developed to extract the required data for input to Apache Spark migration jobs. These queries should include a main query, a CustomerReferenceKey query, an ExternalReferenceKey query, and any other relevant key queries. The queries should be reviewed and run on the P8 database to ensure accurate results.
Detailed Steps
Data Analysis:

Analyze the P8 metadata to identify the required columns for migration.
Update the mapping sheet with source and target column names, default values, required translations, and datatypes.
Gather facts about column data, including null values, all different possible values, and counts.
Batch Table Creation:

Create a separate batch table in the migration database for tracking and reconciliation purposes.
Include necessary columns such as batch ID, record ID, source data, target data, status, and error messages.
Query Development:

Develop P8 queries to extract the required data for input to Apache Spark migration jobs.
Include a main query, a CustomerReferenceKey query, an ExternalReferenceKey query, and any other relevant key queries.
Review and run the queries on the P8 database to ensure accurate results.
Data Migration:

Develop a migration script or tool to extract data from P8 and load it into CDL.
Ensure that the script handles data transformations, validations, and error handling as needed.
Use the batch table to track the progress of the migration and identify any issues.
Data Validation:

Compare the migrated data in CDL with the source data in P8 to verify accuracy and completeness.
Use the batch table to identify and resolve any discrepancies.
Error Handling and Resolution:

Implement a mechanism to capture and log errors that occur during the migration process.
Investigate and resolve any errors or issues that arise.
Additional Considerations
Performance Optimization: Consider techniques to optimize the migration process, such as batching, indexing, and parallel processing.
Data Security: Ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to protect sensitive data during the migration.
Testing and Quality Assurance: Conduct thorough testing to validate the accuracy and completeness of the migrated data.
By following these steps and adhering to the acceptance criteria, we can successfully migrate metadata from P8 to CDL while maintaining data integrity and accuracy.
