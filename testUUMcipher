Technical Incident Brief: Cipher Mismatch Blocking UUM Authentication Integration
Problem Statement
After switching from development to production, the SharePoint-integrated application failed during the WSUUM SOAP-based token request, blocking record declaration and retrieval. The issue did not occur in DEV and no recent code changes were made in this area.

Observed Behavior
WSUUM service calls failed only from the PROD server.

All outbound requests (to both WSUUM-DEV and WSUUM-PROD) failed from PROD.

Requests from DEV to DEV succeeded, confirming valid logic and endpoint behavior.

Direct SOAP calls via curl worked, but the .NET application in PROD failed.

Initial Hypotheses
Investigations explored:

Output caching

Configuration parsing

Runtime framework behavior

WCF vs ASMX interoperability

All were ruled out through controlled cross-environment testing.

Root Cause
The failure stemmed from a malformed encrypted configuration block in <secureAppSettings>:

The encrypted credentials were not re-encrypted in PROD, leading to cipher mismatch during decryption.

Though the encrypted XML was structurally valid, it could not be decrypted using the PROD machine's key, silently causing downstream token generation to fail.

Resolution
The secure config section was re-encrypted on the PROD server using aspnet_regiis -pe.

No code changes were required.

Token acquisition began working immediately.

Diagnostic logging was added to surface future decryption failures.
